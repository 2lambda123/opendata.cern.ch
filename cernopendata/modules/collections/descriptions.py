        'text': 'The ALICE collaboration uses the 10,000-tonne ALICE detector 26 m long, 16 m high and 16 m wide to study quark-gluon plasma. The detector sits in a vast cavern 56 m below ground close to the village of St Genis-Pouilly in France, receiving beams from the LHC. More than 1000 scientists are part of the collaboration.',

        'name': 'CMS',
        'text': 'The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiment is one of two large general-purpose particle physics detectors built on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Switzerland and France. The goal of CMS is to investigate a wide range of physics, including properties of the recently discovered Higgs boson as well as searches for extra dimensions and particles that could make up dark matter.'

        'name': 'ATLAS',
        'text': 'The ATLAS data from 100 trillion proton collisions is now public! This marks the world\'s first open release of 8 TeV data, gathered from the Large Hadron Collider in 2012.<br>ATLAS open data guides you through how to visualise the data, how to download and use the data, and even provide s open-source software for you to make your own discoveries. Get started now!'
