The CERN Open Data Portal classifies each simulated dataset in one category or
subcategory. The scheme used here follows closely the
[CMS Physics Publications](https://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/)
and
[ATLAS Physics Analysis Groups & Summary Plots ](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic/WebHome#Physics%20Analysis%20Groups%20%20Summary)
structures.

## Description

Please find below the description of each category.

### B Physics and Quarkonia

Datasets for bottom and charm quarks production:

- Heavy-quark hadron production, decay and properties.
- Quarkonia properties.

### Higgs Physics

Datasets related Higgs Boson physics including Standard Model and (N)MSSM.

### Standard Model Physics

Datasets for jet, vector-boson production and production of vector-bosons with associated jets:

- Drell Yan and Z/W production (including additional jets).
- Multi vector-boson production.
- Forward and small-X physics (including difractive processes).
- Processes for top quark production.
- Inclusive and multi-jet production.

### Heavy-Ion Physics

Datasets for p-Pb, Pb-Pb collisions, and p-p reference set.

### Beyond 2 Generations

Datasets for new heavy particles, including heavy resonances like Z' and W', diboson resonances, heavy partners of top quark (with vector-like VLQ properties).

### Exotica

Datasets for non-supersymmetric physics beyond the Standard Model: Extra Dimensions, mini Black Holes, Dark Matter, extended Higgs models, Compositeness.

### Supersymmetry

Datasets for production of supersymmetric (SUSY) particles including both R-parity conserving and violating scenarios. ((N)MSSM Higgs boson production is under _Higgs Physics_)

### Physics Modeling

Datasets for Monte Carlo generator studies and tuning, as well as Standard Model Systematic Variations.
