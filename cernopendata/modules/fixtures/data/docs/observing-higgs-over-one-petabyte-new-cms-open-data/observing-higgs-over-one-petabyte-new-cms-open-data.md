The [CMS Collaboration at CERN](https://cms.cern/) is pleased to announce the release of the third batch of high-level open data from the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), available on the [CERN Open Data portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/). This batch contains over 550 terabytes, or 11.6 [inverse femtobarns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_(unit)#Inverse_femtobarn) (fb^&minus;1^), of [proton-proton collision data recorded in 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV](http://opendata.cern.ch/search?experiment=CMS&year=2012&type=Dataset&subtype=Collision) --- around half the data from that year. Around 510 terabytes of Monte Carlo simulation data are also being made available now, with more in the data-transfer pipeline. This release includes datasets that were used to [discover the Higgs boson](https://cms.cern/physics/higgs-boson/observation-new-particle-mass-125-gev) and the data are available in the same format that CMS scientists use for research. CMS is also providing smaller, simplified datasets for use in educational contexts. As previously, the data are released into the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 waiver.
