FIXME PRELIMINARY TEXT

With the growing demand of open science data and increased interest in the CERN Open Data portal, we were working hard on modernizing our web presence. Here, we are telling you more about the changes we made and how you can use the updated portal.

CERN Open Data provides content for both education and research. We aim to support high school students and teachers as well as university students and professors. For that purpose, the new design of CERN Open Data is article-driven. Exciting [guides](/search?type=Documentation&subtype=Guide) introduce to physics analyses and make use of [datasets](/search?type=Dataset). Event displays allow to visualise and imagine what happens during collisions of the smallest elements.

Even though the general public and educators have been on our mind when we redesigned the portal, we did not forget about researchers. It’s quite the opposite actually. Our new search features and updated facets allow for an even more efficient and effective access to relevant [datasets](/search?type=Dataset). We are proud that data released on CERN Open Data led to the [first publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05842) of a research paper outside of any LHC collaboration.

The success of CERN Open Data is made possible through the close connections to various collaborating experiments. So far, we provided access to data and resources from the LHC collaborations [ALICE](/about/alice), [ATLAS](/about/atlas), [CMS](/about/cms) and [LHCb](/about/lhcb). We are proud to announce that together with the release of the updated portal, we are able to welcome the [OPERA](/about/opera) experiment. 
 
We hope that you like our updated portal and appreciate any feedback and comments from your side. Please don’t hesitate to [contact](mailto:opendata-support@cern.ch) us.
