**I want to explore or perform CMS educational exercises for fun or educational purposes**
- Look at all the various [CMS guides](/search?page=1&size=20&type=Documentation&experiment=CMS&subtype=Guide)
- Check out the overview of [CMS Learning resources ](http://opendata.cern.ch/collection/CMS-Learning-Resources) 

**If you are a non-scientist, a high school or first year university student, or a teacher, you might be particularly interested in the "Physics Masterclasses" exercise.
If you are a third year university student or higher, a scientist, or a university teacher, you might be interested in all the exercises.**

**I want to play with CMS real data histograms of physics quantities after having obtained a basic notion of what these physics quantities mean**
- go to the [histogram visualizer](http://opendata.cern.ch/visualise/histograms/CMS) 
- for instructions click on `Need HELP?`

**I want to look at event displays of real events which contributed to the Higgs discovery for fun or educational purposes**

- go to the [CMS event display](http://opendata.cern.ch/visualise/events/CMS) 
- wait for 5 seconds or so, so that the CMS logo hiding the `Open file` button to the left disappears, then click on it,
- choose `Open file(s) from web`,
- choose `Education/` and then
- click on 4lepton.ig or diphoton.ig, and wait for the events to load to the right,
- choose one and click on `Load`

**alternatively,**

- go to the CMS derived dataset `Higgs candidate events for use in education and outreach`: [http://opendata.cern.ch/record/300](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/300)
This will display a 4mu, then 4e, then 2mu2e event (to see electrons, need to switch them on in menu, and switch off tracks)
- to see Higgs->gamma gamma events, click on `diphoton.ig` below and change settings such that one can see the photons.
- can return to multileptons by clicking on `4lepton.ig`

**I want to look at event displays of real J/psi->mumu candidates (and I know what this means)**
- as for Higgs (alternatively) above, except, go to "[Dimuon events with invariant mass range 2-5 GeV for public education and outreach](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/301)" 

**I want to get a help tutorial how to use the options of the event display**
- go to the [CMS event display](http://opendata.cern.ch/visualise/events/CMS) 
- `Need HELP?`

**I want to get an introduction to high energy physics and CMS software in order to prepare myself for an activity in the Research section**
- go to [CMS Learning resources](http://opendata.cern.ch/collection/CMS-Learning-Resources) 
- go to `Computing methods in high energy physics` if you want to learn or refresh the basics of general and CMS computing
then go to `CMS HEP tutorial` if you want to learn some basics about the analysis of 2011 CMS pp data
to visualise event displays for the event classes used in the CMS HEP tutorial, follow the `alternative' instructions for the Higgs event displays above, and choose your favourite sample instead of `more`.

**I want to explore the sophisticated `Outreach Exercise 2010` featuring an analysis of Z decay to two leptons & ZZ decay to four leptons (needs installation of a virtual machine and software environment as detailed under `Research` below). A video tutorial can be found under * does this actually still work?**
- go to [CMS Open Data Instructions](http://opendata.cern.ch/collection/CMS-Open-Data-Instructions) 
- "Video tutorial for Outreach Exercise 2010"

**I want to access historic information on 'older' educational datasets released in 2010 and 2011: [CMSPublicData2011](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/CMSPublicData2011).**

**I ran into a problem and need help**
