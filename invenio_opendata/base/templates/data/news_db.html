                                          We are close to the first public release of CMS reconstructed data and the appropriate working environments. This release consists of primary dataset files in AOD format from 2010 RunB. We know that a considerable amount of additional knowledge is required in order to obtain meaningful results with these, and we have provided a minimal set of background information and some examples for external users to get started with our data. We also provide examples of how to further use these data in teaching and education.

                                          The biggest audience we foresee is in education. We will provide examples of simplified, ready-to-use, online applications on the portal: at the moment this includes an event display for CMS events and a simple histogramming tool is on its way. For people interested in building similar applications, we provide the source code with basic instructions for the tools and the software for event processing they need.

                                          We would like to call for feedback from the CMS Collaboration: you will have received a detailed email with our request. Please do contact us if you would like to host your own exercises here or have ideas for how the CMS open data could be further used.

     ('ALICE OpenData','<p>ALICE is making a public release of a number of datasets customised for
                demonstration and educational purpose. A number of reconstructed data
                files which are not statistically representative are included to allow
                plotting transverse momentum and pseudorapidity distributions. More
                advanced analysis and tools as well as larger data samples will be
                available in future releases.</p><p>At this stage we are making available a set of outreach and educational
        analysis exercises. These are based on specifically-selected ALICE data
        and are widely used for the particle physics masterclasses. These
        exercises expose simplified tools, which however give the feel of the
        real tools employed by the physicists for the data analysis, and come in
        the form of analysis packages and small datasets organised as root
        files. Each analysis downloads on demand the required software and data
        from a common graphics interface.</p><p>The documentation coming with these exercises contains both some physics
        introduction and the instructions for running the programs, which
        highlight some of the ALICE physics.  One exercise is the search for
        particles containing strange quarks, based on their V0 decays; the
        motivation is to give an insight to strangeness enhancement, one of the
        first signatures for the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP).  Another exercise
        basically looks at charged particle tracks; the aim is to calculate the
        nuclear modification factor RAA, by comparing particle yields in the
        case of lead-lead and proton-proton collisions; the fact that RAA is
        less than one indicates the suppression of charged particles due to
        interactions of partons with the QGP.</p>','ALICE Collaboration',('3',(),('news', 'ALICE', 'statements', 'opendata')),'2')
